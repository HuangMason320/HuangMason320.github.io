## Emmanuel Chabrier (Arr. José SCHYNS): España

"Spanish Rhapsody" is a piano duet composed by French composer Chabrier after a trip to Spain, which later developed into a complete orchestral work. This work was immediately praised by many musicians at the time. For example, Falla believed that "even Spanish composers could not write such authentic jota dance music," and Mahler told members of the New York Philharmonic that "this piece is the beginning of modern music." At the same time, Chabrier's work opened up the Spanish style in French music, which was further developed in subsequent works such as Debussy's "Iberia" and Satie's "Españaña." 

Tonight's performance features the version arranged by Belgian trombonist and arranger José SCHYNS.

## Antón Alcalde: Symphony No. 1 "Marea Negra" (Taiwan Premiere)

Antón Alcalde was born in 1992 in the autonomous region of Galicia in northern Spain and currently resides in Taiwan. He has won five consecutive first prizes at the Galician Composition Competition (Concurso de Composición Gallego) (2009, 2010, 2011) and is the youngest winner of this competition.

This Symphony No. 1 is also the composer's Opus 1, written when he was 15 years old. The composer himself says "this work is both my most immature work and the work I admire most about myself." The work describes the Greek oil tanker "Prestige," one of the most significant oil spill incidents in maritime history to date, and follows symphonic tradition by being divided into four movements:

    I. Dawn in the Rías Baixas (Amencer nas Rías Baixas)

    II. Prestige (Prestige)

    III. Black Tide (Marea Negra)

    IV. White Tide (Marea Blanca)

In November 2002, the Prestige encountered giant waves that caused damage to the ship's hull, ultimately running aground and then breaking into two pieces, directly causing nearly 70,000 tons of fuel oil to spill into the sea. This contaminated 500 kilometers of coastline and nearly 200 beaches across Spain, France, and Portugal. It harmed local fisheries and ecosystems, with some species even becoming extinct as a result. This catastrophe took ten years and billions of dollars in cleanup costs to gradually resolve.

This symphony won first prize in the symphony category of the Galician Composition Competition in 2009 and became the required piece for the following year's Galician Wind Band Competition. In 2022, the composer revised this piece, and tonight's performance features the revised version. This is not only the first performance in Taiwan but also the first time the composer himself has personally conducted this work.

## Manuel de Falla: El sombrero de tres picos

"The Three-Cornered Hat" refers to the triangular hat worn by local officials. Originally a short story written by novelist Pedro Antonio de Alarcón (1833-1891) based on folk tales from the Andalusian region, Falla composed it as a two-act ballet. The currently popular version consists of two suites subsequently edited from the ballet music, utilizing many Spanish folk dances and vividly presenting visual imagery.

The suite's five movements include:

---

### I. Introduction
Using timpani's perfect fifth intervals to lead the trumpet in playing fanfares. In the original ballet, one would also hear villagers clapping with castanets and hands while shouting "Olé! Olé!"

### II. Dance of the Miller's Wife
This melody is heard when the miller and his wife often confirm their mutual affection amid feelings of jealousy and suspicion.

### III. The Neighbours' Dance
Residents dance the Seguidilla to celebrate festivals.

### IV. The Miller's Dance
French horns play the passionate Farruca dance.

### V. Final Dance
The main melody Jota creates a magnificent atmosphere—though chaotic and noisy, it ultimately reaches a satisfying grand finale.

## Oscar Navarro: Libertadores

"The Liberator" is an award-winning work by Spanish composer Oscar Navarro, divided into two parallel structures. One describes the scenery of the South American Amazon rainforest and the life of primitive tribes along the river, while the other part narrates the deeds of Simón Bolívar, known as "The Liberator," and General José de San Martín leading Latin America's liberation from Spanish colonial rule.

Therefore, the entire piece is filled with rich South American folk music elements. Besides percussion instruments full of rainforest atmosphere, it also uses different wind instruments to simulate bird calls in the forest, features folk dance melodies played by clarinet, and French horns further proclaim the liberator's deeds with magnificent fanfares. The composer also specifically requires detailed body movements from ensemble members to allow the music to be presented on stage through visual means. In the magnificent drumming of the final section, a group of military drums march out, making the piece end in passionate excitement.
