## James Barnes: Symphonic Overture
Symphonic Overture was commissioned by the United States Air Force Band to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary, composed by James Barnes (b. 1949), one of today’s most renowned wind band composers and educators. Born in Oklahoma, Barnes currently teaches in the School of Music at the University of Kansas. His works are widely recognized for their accessibility, dramatic character, and masterful treatment of the wind ensemble.

The piece is structured in a traditional A–B–A form (Allegro–Adagio–Allegro), echoing the spirit of the classical symphony.

The first Allegro opens with a brilliant and majestic brass fanfare, followed by a lyrical oboe melody, establishing two contrasting thematic ideas.

The Adagio features a solo for alto saxophone, later concluding with the warm sonority of the euphonium, transforming the earlier motives into a more melancholic and song-like atmosphere.

The final Allegro develops the main themes in alternation between brass and woodwinds, driving toward a climactic ending where the recurring motives reappear with dramatic intensity.

Showcasing both lyrical beauty and technical brilliance, Symphonic Overture exemplifies Barnes’s artistry in wind orchestration and remains a significant contribution to the modern concert band repertoire.

## Frank Ticheli: Loch Lomond

Loch Lomond is located on the edge of the Scottish Highlands and is the largest freshwater lake in Great Britain. Dotted with more than thirty islands—whose number appears to change with the seasons—it has been ranked among the “Greatest Natural Wonders of Britain.”

The song “Loch Lomond” is a traditional Scottish folk ballad that has been passed down for generations. It tells the story of a captured soldier sentenced to death, who, unable to bid farewell to his beloved in person, entrusts his released comrade to deliver a final message to her on the shores of Loch Lomond.

American composer Frank Ticheli (b. 1958) reimagined this folk tune in his wind band setting. The work begins in a calm and reflective atmosphere, gradually building toward the main theme where the tender melody of the ballad emerges. A lighter, more animated passage follows, leading the music to its dramatic climax, before it subsides into tranquility once more. Through Ticheli’s arrangement, the grandeur of the Highland landscape seems to unfold before the listener, while the timeless sense of longing and human emotion resonates deeply.

## Robert W. Smith: The Star of Dreams

"Dream Star" is set in 19th century Texas, depicting the dreams and legends of a group of cowboys with passionate ideals for expanding the American West. Composed by Robert W. Smith (1958-), America's most popular and prolific contemporary wind band composer, the entire piece is divided into three movements, majestic in scope yet delicate in emotion.

The first movement, "Los Diablos Tejanos" (The Texas Devils), opens with a French horn fanfare symbolizing the urgent signal heard by furiously galloping cowboys. The subsequent syncopated rhythms outline the perilous scenes of cowboys crossing the desert in battle, while abundant brass melodies commemorate the cowboys' sacrifice and dedication.

The second movement, "In the Fields of Blue," depicts the blue flowers "Bluebonnets" scattered throughout Texas. It begins with a gentle clarinet solo passage, then returns to brass melodies leading listeners to soar once again above the desert, forming a stark contrast with the vast floral landscape.

The third movement, "Stampede," presents through percussion instruments the clouds of dust kicked up by horses as cowboys gallop. French horn melodies symbolize the hardships and struggles of the pioneers' pioneering efforts, then immediately transition to a jubilant 5/4 rhythm praising the cowboys' perseverance and vision, finally concluding with woodwind ascending scales and majestic French horn fanfares.

## Jacob de Haan: Oregon

"Oregon" is a fantasy piece depicting the state of Oregon in the United States, composed by Dutch composer Jacob de Haan (1959-). The entire work intersperses several melodies with different tempos, keys, and rhythms, presenting characteristics similar to film music.

The initial slow section serves as an introduction to the first theme melody. Upon entering the fast section, trombone imitating train steam whistle sounds opens the piece, and the first theme melody appears. The rhythm section uses snare drum imitating the regular sounds of a speeding train as background, then transitions to jazz rhythms, cleverly combining western style with rock style.

The middle slow section, led by French horn and trumpet fanfares, enters the second theme melody, whose beautiful singing lines form a contrast with the first theme. After returning to the fast section, the entire piece enters the third theme, which combines jazz, blues, and other various styles. Finally, it declares the end of the journey with a grand and magnificent tutti. Through this piece, listeners seemingly tour the entire state of Oregon, taking in magnificent scenery and cultural atmosphere.

## Tohko Takagi: March "Blue Sky"

"Blue Sky March" was one of the required pieces for the 2007 All-Japan Band Competition. When composer Tohko Takagi (1969-) created this piece, she named it "Blue Sky," hoping the entire work would possess the expansive feeling of blue sky, while setting an appropriate tempo to present the sensation of clouds flowing lightly. Performers must constantly pay attention to chromatic and harmonic changes to faithfully present the bright blue sky tone the composer desired.

The "All-Japan Band Competition" is an annual event co-hosted by the All-Japan Band Association and Asahi Shimbun. Each year, approximately 800,000 participants take part, including middle school students, high school students, university students, and working professionals, totaling approximately 14,000 participating ensembles. The competition is fierce and can be called the grand festival of wind music throughout Japan.

## Arr. Toshio Mashima: Beauty and the Beast Medley
"Beauty and the Beast" is an animated film released by The Walt Disney Company in 1991, adapted from the classic fairy tale of the same name. The story depicts how the selfish Prince Adam, punished by a curse and transformed into a beast, meets the beautiful girl Belle. Through their time together, he attempts to change himself and learns to understand each other, leading to mutual appreciation. Finally, Adam breaks the curse through Belle's sincere confession of love, successfully transforming back into a prince, with everything in the castle returning to normal, and they live happily ever after.

The music in the animation was composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Howard Ashman. In the same year, it won two major awards at the 64th Academy Awards: Best Original Score and Best Original Song.

The "Beauty and the Beast Suite" performed here was arranged for wind ensemble by Japanese composer and arranger Toshio Mashima (1949-2016). The entire work contains four major sections: the first section "Prologue" opens with low voices, then reveals the curtain after layering high voices; the second section "Belle" expresses the melancholy and heavy mood of the heroine Belle; the third section "Something There" uses a light and bright musical style to show Belle's excitement when spending time with Mrs. Potts and other good friends in the castle; the fourth section "Beauty and the Beast," serving as the animation's theme song, plays an enduring melody for the couple's love.

## Naohiro Iwai: Disney Fantasy

"Disney Fantasy" was arranged by Japanese composer and arranger Naohiro Iwai (1923-2014) from multiple classic Disney animated film scores. The piece combines many familiar melodies—do these songs perhaps evoke childhood memories for everyone?

It begins with the most well-known "Mickey Mouse March," leading everyone into a journey through "It's a Small World." After a brief stay, the composer shifts the scene to the seven dwarfs singing "Heigh Ho," who happily depart after working hard at their mining. Later, the three little pigs appear, cheerfully singing "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" while discussing how to build a sturdy house to resist the big bad wolf's attacks. At this point, the composer shifts the scene back to Snow White, who "expects that someday my prince will come" (Someday My Prince Will Come), and while earnestly cleaning, still doesn't forget to sing "Whistle While You Work" with her animal friends. Finally, it concludes with "When You Wish upon a Star" from Pinocchio, hoping that everyone can break through obstacles, overcome difficulties, and make their dreams come true.

## Bert Appermont: Ivanhoe
"Ivanhoe" is based on the novel of the same name by 18th-century novelist Walter Scott. The story takes place in 12th-century England, with the main plot centered on the old Saxons, who are determined to restore their nation, opposing the oppressive Normans. It also interweaves struggles for the throne among Norman royalty and romantic entanglements between different ethnic groups. This novel was later adapted into the highly acclaimed Hollywood film "Ivanhoe" in 1952.

This piece was composed by Belgian composer Bert Appermont (1973-) and is divided into three movements. First movement "Code of Chivalry": The opening features magnificent brass fanfares and beautiful woodwind main melodies symbolizing the chivalric spirit filled with pride and honor, then transitions to a 6/8 dance, praising everything noble. Second movement "Loyalty or Love?": Beginning with a euphonium solo, gradually building emotions, expressing the conflicted feelings of the protagonist Ivanhoe torn between his father and his lover, between loyalty and love. Increasingly complex thoughts torment Ivanhoe's mind and body, and the music builds toward a climax accordingly. Third movement "Battle & Finale": Describes Ivanhoe's brave battle with the Templar knights, during which he receives help from the Black Knight and achieves victory. He not only reconciles with his father but also wins his lover's heart. The entire piece returns to the glorious first movement theme before reaching a perfect conclusion.
