## Claude T. Smith: Festival Variations
"Festival Variations" is a magnificent work by American composer Claude T. Smith, commissioned by the US Air Force Band for the 50th anniversary of MENC (now NAfME) and premiered in San Antonio. At its premiere, conductor Arnald Gabriel declared "the perfect combination of technical demands and romantic style in this work will make it one of the most important works of the 20th century." Despite the extremely high technical challenges of this work, its charm still makes countless musicians eager to attempt it.

This piece is written in ternary (three-part) structure. It opens with a lively and colorful allegro theme, features a development section with an emotional and tragic andante, and concludes with an energetic recapitulation. In the allegro sections, the rising and falling scales and repeated rhythms bring infinite vitality and passion to the audience. In the andante section, we can feel a deep and heartbreaking melancholic emotion.

Interestingly, it's said that the French horn passage in this piece was specifically created by Mr. Smith to challenge Johnny Woody, who was the principal French horn of the US Air Force Band at the time. The piece is not only full of amazing technical challenges but also contains many fascinating stories.

## Carlos Marques: Concertino for Tuba and Symphonic Band

Carlos Marques was born in Aveiro, Portugal in 1973. At age 10, he began studying trumpet at the Aveiro Music Academy. He later studied composition and music theory at the Military Music School, where he played trumpet in the jazz big band for 9 years, which also provided excellent training for his arranging and composition skills. His works have been used as required pieces for several European wind band competitions, and he is frequently invited by Portuguese performers to create commissioned works. Marques has also ventured into conducting, studying under multiple conductors. He currently teaches at the Porto Music Academy and serves as conductor of the academy's symphony orchestra.

This piece was composed in 2007 and dedicated to tuba player Adélio Carneiro. The composer attempted to explore how the tuba, a relatively uncommon instrument, could interweave with the ensemble as a soloist within a short duration to create an exciting work that showcases its technique and expressiveness. The piece has no movement divisions, but the composer uses three distinctly different characters to roughly divide the piece into three sections: a signal-like strong and powerful theme, a lyrical long melodic line, and a brilliant virtuosic finale.

## Ito Yasuhide: Symphonic Poems "Gloriosa"
Gloriosa is a symphonic poem composed of three movements.

The first movement, "Oratio," meaning "Prayer," is an ancient and solemn "Chaconne," using Gregorian chant that was introduced to Japan at the time as the variation theme. In this movement, Yasuhide Ito depicts the conflicts and friction that occurred between Christianity and local culture when Christianity was introduced to Japan. Therefore, one hears many harmonies and rhythms with strong coloristic character, symbolizing the resistance Christianity faced when first introduced to Japan.

The second movement, "Cantus," meaning "Song," is the "Song of Saint Juan" sung by hidden Christians. In this movement, Ito uses a traditional Japanese instrument called the "ryuteki" (dragon flute). The ryuteki's distant and melancholic flute sound tells a tragic story, as if the story being told happened just yesterday.

The third movement, "Dies Festus," meaning "Festival," is based on variations of the traditional Japanese folk song "Nagasaki Burabura-bushi." Strong festival coloration is this movement's greatest characteristic. The theme "Nagasaki Burabura-bushi" heard in this movement constantly appears in various forms through brilliant orchestration techniques and rhythmic variations. Tragic and heroic emotions appear in the middle, telling of the obstructions and obstacles faced during the process of Christianity merging with Japanese local culture. The fugue that follows, brought by saxophone and clarinet, sees Ito融ing the most popular compositional method of the Baroque era into Japanese traditional folk songs, adding his own unique creative techniques, increasing the ensemble's difficulty while providing an extremely satisfying auditory experience.

At the piece's conclusion, the Gregorian chant theme from the first movement reappears, declaring the new cultural force produced by the combination of Christianity and Japanese culture, finally moving toward a brilliant future in a victorious posture.

## Pietro Mascagni (Arr. Koh Shishikura): Selection from "Cavalleria Rusticana"
鄉村騎士 Cavalleria Rusticana 是一齣於1890年由義大利作曲家 Pietro Mascagni 作曲的獨幕歌劇，描述義大利西西里的兩對男女間因三角戀情而引起的悲劇。
此次演出的版本為Koh Shishikura於2007年編寫的組曲，選取一共三段，分別為:

Preludio e Siciliana, 以樹敵悠揚的高音揭開序幕，美麗麗兒平靜的旋律線與即將發生的悲慘事件形成對比。前奏曲到達最高潮時，卻忽然靜下來，鋼琴引出的西西里舞曲，盡是男主角對前女友蘿拉的愛意。
Viva il vino spumeggiante! 男主與其前女友在廣場與眾人歡快的飲酒！過癮似神仙！
Scena e Preghiera, 此木描寫眾多信徒於教堂裡虔誠禱告的場景，其中禱告的人也包含尚未發現七子外遇的阿爾費歐，以及心中忐忑的桑圖札，正猶豫要不要將外遇一事告訴阿爾費歐，祈禱杜立都會回心轉意。Mascagni 巧妙地將桑圖札的猶疑融入信徒和唱的聖歌，「信」與「懷疑」巧妙地交相輝映，譜出動人的樂章
