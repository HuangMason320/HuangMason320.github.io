It is my first time stepping onto the stage of the National Concert Hall, the most prestigious concert hall in Taiwan.

## Ferrer Ferran: Alba Overture (Taiwan Premiere)

The Spanish composer **Ferrer Ferran** (b.1966), nurtured by a rich musical tradition, began studying piano and percussion at the age of 15. He later earned degrees in composition and conducting from the Royal Academy of Music in London. Currently teaching at the Conservatory of Valencia, Ferran remains an active composer. Among his works, the oboe concerto *El Bosque Mágico* (*The Magic Forest*) is perhaps the most familiar to Taiwanese audiences.  

The title of this overture, *Alba*, traces back to the Spanish writer **Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra** (1547–1616), who in the 16th century wrote *Don Quixote*, a groundbreaking parody of the then-popular chivalric romances. Set in an age when knights had long disappeared, the story follows Don Quixote, who imagines himself a knight and embarks on a series of absurd adventures, only to awaken from his fantasies in the end. Tradition has it that Cervantes completed the novel while imprisoned in **Argamasilla de Alba**, a small town in central Spain. Some scholars even argue that Alba itself was the setting for Don Quixote’s earliest adventures.  

Today, Argamasilla de Alba remains a modest town of fewer than seven thousand inhabitants, yet it upholds Spain’s long and vibrant tradition of community music-making. Local music societies—often with histories spanning a century or more—frequently include children’s ensembles, youth bands, jazz groups, symphonic wind orchestras, and even full symphony orchestras. Participants range from young children to centenarians, and rivalries between societies can sometimes be fierce.  

One such figure is **Miguel Carlos Gómez Perona** (b.1970), who in 1993 returned to his hometown to lead the local society *Maestro Martín Díaz*. Under his guidance, the ensemble thrived within the small town. In 2012, Ferran composed *Alba Overture* for *Maestro Martín Díaz*. His friendship with Carlos was so close that in 2011, Ferran had already dedicated another composition to him personally.  

The overture opens with a majestic fanfare in the brass, followed by a lively dance-like passage led by the woodwinds’ flowing eighth notes. The cheerful and straightforward main theme symbolizes the camaraderie among ensemble members, while clapping gestures represent their warmth and enthusiasm. The tambourine and snare drum further propel the music with playful rhythms.  

The middle section shifts into a lyrical and tender Adagio, portraying the deep bond built over many years between conductor and players—sometimes passionate, sometimes intimate. The finale returns to a joyful Allegro, where the sound of castanets, an unmistakable hallmark of Spanish music, bursts forth with energy and brilliance. As the music grows in intensity, the reappearance of the main theme drives it toward a climactic conclusion.  

Unlike the playful opening, the ending is noble and radiant, as if declaring to all listeners:  
**“Music is the finest medium to connect people with one another.”**

## Chang-An CHEN: Horn Concertino with soloist, John WANG (Taiwan Premiere)

The composer drew upon his own past experience as a horn player to create this single-movement, three-part work. The opening begins with a lyrical Adagio, where the warm tone of the horn gradually expands the atmosphere and leads into the second section, an *Allegro con brio*. In this lively part, the main theme alternates between the orchestra and the solo horn; each recurrence of the same phrase is treated with fresh contrasts and inventive designs, showcasing the brilliance and virtuosity of the horn.  

The third section adopts a slightly slower tempo, where the horn melody unfolds over a chorale-like accompaniment from the low brass, then passes into a dialogue with the woodwinds. Long horn phrases return, supported by rich and colorful harmonies.  

The final part bursts forth with orchestral energy, weaving together motives from earlier sections in a dazzling interplay of colors, eventually returning to the recapitulation of the *Allegro*. The concerto closes by recalling the very first theme, bringing the work to a radiant conclusion filled with variation, brilliance, and the horn’s dazzling technique.

## Nigel Hess: Shakespeare Pictures

After graduating from Cambridge University, **Nigel Hess** devoted himself to composing music for film, television, and the stage, developing a style that is light, accessible, and engaging. In 2007, at the request of the then Prince of Wales (now King Charles III), he composed a piano concerto for **Queen Elizabeth II**, which was premiered by the Chinese pianist Lang Lang. Hess has written numerous works for wind band; the NTU Alumni Wind Orchestra has performed several of them over the years, including *East Coast Pictures* and *Global Variations*. In 2014, under Professor Kuo Lien-Chang’s direction, the ensemble gave the Taiwan premiere of *New London Pictures*, which prompted Hess himself to post a response on YouTube.  

Hess also has a deep connection with Shakespeare. He has served as Composer-in-Residence at the **Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre**, and has written music for more than twenty productions with the **Royal Shakespeare Company**. *Shakespeare Pictures*, commissioned in 2008 by the **Birmingham Symphonic Winds**, is a three-movement suite adapted from his earlier Shakespearean stage scores.

### I. *Much Ado About Nothing* (0:23)  
Adapted from the **Entr’acte** of Shakespeare’s comedy, this movement opens with a bright melody and lively rhythms, gradually unfolding into a festive ballroom scene filled with laughter, elegance, and dance. A contrasting quieter section follows, creating a shadow against the earlier brilliance, before the music returns with powerful brass unisons, restoring the grandeur and jubilance of the opening.  

### II. *The Winter’s Tale – The Statue* (4:20)  
Drawn from Act V, Scene iii of Shakespeare’s late romance, the dramatic climax comes as Hermione, believed long dead, is miraculously revealed alive: *“It is required you do awake your faith. Behold! She’s alive!”* The music begins with a gentle flute duet, echoed by murmuring clarinet lines, then shifts to ethereal harp figures and plaintive oboe solos. Lyrical and sorrowful, the passage conveys the Queen’s long-suppressed grief finally released in her return to life.  

### III. *Julius Caesar – The Entry to the Senate* (9:23)  
This movement depicts Caesar’s fateful march into the Senate. A flute solo serves as a fragile prelude, foreshadowing his impending doom. A martial snare drum quickens the pace, introducing noble brass fanfares reminiscent of ceremonial court music. As the trumpets resound, Caesar steps into the Senate chamber. Suddenly, the music collapses into uneasy harmonies of clarinet, saxophone, and euphonium, heightening the tension. The trumpets return once more, with organ sonorities amplifying the drama. In Shakespeare’s play, Caesar is struck down by 23 stab wounds at the hands of the conspirators in the Roman Senate, bringing the tragedy to its grim close.

## Bert Appermont: Saga Candida

**Bert Appermont** first studied conducting at the Lemmens Institute in Leuven, Belgium, and later pursued film scoring in the United Kingdom. His oeuvre spans not only wind band works but also theater music and symphonies, often inspired by mythology and historical narratives. The NTU Alumni Wind Orchestra has previously performed several of his well-known pieces, including *Noah’s Ark*, *Gulliver’s Travels*, *Celtic Child*, and *Age of Aquarius*.  

*Zaad van Satan* (*Seed of Satan*) was originally a contemporary music drama based on a libretto by **Jef Mellemnas**, with Dutch texts sung alongside wind band accompaniment. From this theatrical score, Appermont reworked and orchestrated portions into a stand-alone concert piece, while other unused material was later developed into another composition, *Saga Maligna*.  

The drama unfolds in a 17th-century Flemish village, where **Elisabeth**, a pregnant woman known for her knowledge of herbs, tended to the illnesses of her neighbors. After her husband died while gathering herbs, suspicion arose that her unborn child was the “seed of Satan.” Meanwhile, the mayor arranged a marriage between his son **Thomas** and the daughter of a wealthy landowner, though Thomas secretly loved Elisabeth’s daughter **Kathalijne**. Gossip and malice spread, twisting into accusations that Kathalijne was a witch who must be burned at the stake.  

Tragedy deepens when Elisabeth, devastated by her daughter’s persecution, suffers a miscarriage. On the eve of the execution, she frees Kathalijne from her chains and urges Thomas to flee with her daughter, choosing instead to take her place at the stake. A priest who witnessed this act of sacrifice could not prevent the outcome: the next day, in a frenzy of blind rage, the villagers burned Elisabeth alive, never once meeting her eyes. In his final prayer, the priest begged for her soul to be lifted to heaven.  

Appermont restructured the musical material for concert performance, altering the sequence and even giving some movements new titles. The resulting work, *Saga Candida*—literally “the one who should not be punished”—bears the subtitle **“7 Impressions of a Witch Hunt.”** It presents seven contrasting musical tableaux that evoke fear, suspicion, tragedy, and transcendence. The witch hunts continued well into the 19th century in parts of Europe and North America, a grim reminder of how fear of the unknown can transform into persecution of the innocent. Listening today, one cannot help but ask: *are we truly so different in our own time?*
